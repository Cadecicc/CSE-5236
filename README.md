# Friendly Fire!   
## Mobile App Dev Project CSE 5236

This app will allow for groups of friends to bet on each other’s actions throughout the course of a social gathering without the concern of losing large amounts of cash.
To begin a game, one person must open their application and select “Start Game”. This will create an online lobby for other players to join along with a randomly generated code which grants other players access to said lobby. Once the other players have the join code entered, they will join the lobby which was created by the host of the game party. After every player has joined, the host can start the game, and roles are given to each player.
	
	
There are three role types assigned in the game: the Bookie, the Betters, and the Subject. The Bookie is the player who creates the moneyline for a custom bet, and they have sole ownership of what gets counted towards the moneyline. Every time an action is performed that the bet describes, the Bookie adds a tally which makes the total action count closer to the moneyline. The Betters will place their wagers on the moneyline which the Bookie makes, choosing if their bet is higher or lower than the money line, and the winners go home with the opposing betters’ money. As for the Subject, they are the ones which will be bet on. The Bookie creates a bet which is tailored to the Subject’s actions, and the moneyline is the over/under for how many times the Subject will commit a certain action. The Subject will not know which of their actions will be bet on, so they have no choice but to act normal. If the Subject performs an action more times than the Bookie’s moneyline lists, then the over bet would win. If the Subject underperforms, then the under bet wins.
	
	
To ensure that payments are exchanged after a game ends, each user is required to hook up their venmo account to their account so it can request and be requested venmo cash from other players.
